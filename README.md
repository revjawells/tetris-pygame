# tetris.py - A tetris impelemented in pygame

This is written in Python 2.7 and PyGame 1.9.4.post1.

I began writing this following
[this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoR4ilCWwKA).
As I follored the tutorial, I thought of ways that I would prefer to write
it myself. So, I made this major rewrite that I find makes more sense.
